        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At FruitImpact, we believe that making conscious food choices can have a
          profound impact on both personal health and the environment. Our goal is
          to inspire people to embrace a more plant-based diet by making it easy
          to access nutritional information about fruits and other natural foods.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Why Plant-Based?</h2>
        <p>
          A plant-based diet offers numerous benefits. Not only can it help improve
          overall well-being, but it also plays a crucial role in reducing
          environmental footprints. By choosing more fruits and vegetables, we
          promote a sustainable lifestyle that supports biodiversity and reduces
          greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Empowering You</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to empower users to make informed decisions by providing accurate
          and easy-to-understand nutritional values for various fruits. Whether
          you're looking for healthier options or curious about the nutritional
          content of a particular fruit, FruitImpact helps you on your journey
          toward a more sustainable and balanced diet.
